This is my programming coursework it's a room booking system it's just running the tests to show that 
they all pass. It uses a JavaScript open source scheduler to display the events passport for authentication 
and also uses the bootstrap framework. It's hosted locally and it's also hosted on heroku which Iâ€™ll include 
a link in my submission. I tried to keep the interface quite simple it's got a simple grid layout with a 
hamburger menu at the top and it's centred around the calendar so it's always quick and easy to get back to 
the calendar. Within the hamburger menu you can choose which room you want to book with a carousel to show 
what they look like and some information. This does a get request to fetch a JSON array of events and then 
are displayed by the calendar. You can't book a room until you've logged in or signed up. You need a unique 
username and two passwords that match. In this case a and b which don't match so they need to be a and a and 
then the username at the top is already taken so that needs to be a unique one. Once this is through you've
got the next stage, fill in your personal information, finish sign up and that'll log you in and display the 
booking button which will open the booking overlay. You have the name, date, start time, end time; all which 
are required and validated and the description is optional. If the time that you try to select isn't valid it
won't let you post it to the server until it's a valid event. Which it then posts to the server and inserts 
it into the array and it will be displayed when it is re-rendered. Just to show that it persists when moving
between different room schedules and that this can be done at any point as well as when you've signed up you
can log out and to show you can sign back in again after you've signed out
